            <p>The new iPhones are coming. So if you plan to buy a new iPhone today, 
			well hold on to that thought because we are expecting to see not one but two new iPhones by tomorrow, 
			September 10 in an event at its Cupertino headquarters where they promise to “brighten everyone’s day”. 
			The iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. Rumors and leaks have been flying around a quite some time now, 
			but Apple has managed to keep its secrets locked up safely. Apple is also expected to launch the release dates of iOS7, 
			the next version of the iPhone and iPad software.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Apple is believed to a be testing on larger screens as large as 6 inches, 
			but it might be some time before they actually release such a product in the market. 
			The Apple chief, Timothy D. Cook criticizes competitors on sacrificing the screen quality for a larger size and 
			hints that the company can do better. 
			Apple finished its second quarter of fiscal 2013 with $9.5 billion in profit on $43.6 billion in sales. 
			The company sold 37.4 million iPhones and 19.5 million iPads during the quarter.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Talking about the new iPhone 5S (Same), 
			it is a way to sell the exact same iPhone a year later and still sell millions just changing the name. 
			People really don’t want change and it would really make no sense in changing one of the best phones ever made. 
			It seems as if you won’t even notice the difference in the new upgraded iPhone. 
			It is believed that you would still get the same display screen size, 
			still no NFC and the same cold feel of hard cold metal in your hand. 
			Rumours also say that the new iPhone would have an encrypted fingerprint sensor and maybe an improved camera with a new led flash.
			Thankfully, the talks about the gaudy “gold iPhone” is now believed to be more of a subtle champagne color.</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			The other new product iPhone 5C (Cheap), has a plastic back and is expected to have a less screen resolution, 
			less memory capacity, less powerful camera, 
			older and slower processor to basically bring down the overall cost of the iPhone so as even the peasant could afford it.
			Or is it really. 
			The ‘C’ may even stand for China as it appears that Apple’s scheduled press conference for September 11 in Beijing 
			is linked to the landmark iPhone deal with China Mobile, which could see the launch of iPhone 5C. 
			Well, in terms of color, other than the plain old black and white, 
			it is expected to have a rainbow range of colors to choose from (blue, yellow, green, red and white).
			</p>
            <br>
			<p>
			It all seems like a marketing stunt to gather large chunks of the market from their competitor Samsung and Android operating 
			mobile phones. 
			Apple is trying to change its reputation from a costly mobile to compete with the existing less expensive phones for 
			that share of the market. The iPhone 5S may just be another distraction to keep the people talking about the cheaper model. 
			Hopefully by tomorrow all our questions regarding the new iPhones will be out there and the long awaited cheaper model 
			of iPhone would be available in the market.
