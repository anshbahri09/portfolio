			<p>Ahead of the availability of the new iPhone in retail this Friday, 
			reviewers have been talking about the new phones and Apple's new mobile operating system iOS7. 
			According to Washington Post, Walt Mossberg says that overall the phone is a “delight” 
			and that its software and hardware make it the “best smartphone on the market”. 
			Furthermore David Pogue from New York Times reviews the phone fairly favorable, 
			calling the 5C a “terrific phone”. His highest praise is for the software on the phone, 
			which he said has been redesigned for ease and functionality. However, 
			there are a few problems with the new iPhone which could act as a glitch for Apple over the next year in 
			selling millions of phones.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Most of the modifications made in the camera feel incomplete. 
			Apple talked up the 1.5 micron sensor pixels of the iPhone 5S. 
			The new phone has a redesigned camera array and an improved flash. 
			While comparing it with competitors like Nokia and HTC One has a 2.1 micron sensor sensor pixels, 
			they’re not that large. The iPhone 5S has an f/2.2 lens, 
			which is not that impressive when we look at the Nokia Lumia 720 with an f/1.9 lens. 
			With hardly any more changes in the hardware, most of the magic is done in the software. Its clever, 
			but far away from what a 'proper' camera would provide.</p>
			<br>            
			<p>Rumors about the Touch ID Scanner, or the fingerprint scanner turned out to be true. 
			Using a capacitive sensor to judge the exact properties of the fingerprint is a very smart and cool thing to have 
			on your home screen. 
			However, you would have to take off your gloves to unlock the phone without reverting to the old passcode system. 
			The use of the scanner is very limited, because the sensor will never be able to be used third party app developer. 
			Don't get me wrong, the phones are very good but you are so limited in what Apple wants you to do. 
			What if you forgot your phone at home and need your wife to check something on it for you? Pretty stupid idea, 
			don't you think? Instead why can't the S5 be used to “short cut” a specific finger to the opening of a specific app? 
			Say for instance your fore finger opens your phone to the home screen but when you open the phone with the 
			middle finger it shortcuts to opening your facebook.</p>     
			<br>			
			<p>
			When you come to think of the screen size, it looks very tiny in front of the rivals Samsung. 
			Apple has stuck with the screen size to try and fit the phone in anyone’s hands. 
			They need to realize that people have gotten used to holding a larger phone that might not even fit in the palm. 
			According to a new CNN report, Apple is testing iPhone display screens as large as 6 inches.
			Citing "people familiar with the matter,”
			the Wall Street Journal reported that the bigger screens could signal a future move by Apple to offer iPhones of 
			various sizes. This change would put them more in line with the chief competitors like Samsung, 
			which has taken away a major share of the market with devices like Galaxy S and Galaxy Note lines.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Yet again, Apple has managed to disappoint its costumers by not providing the NFC (Near Field Communication) 
			in its hardware which says it all really. Nowadays, 
			this technology is fairly common with high-end phones which lets NFC capable devices to transfer data and 
			even talk to each other over short distances. You still have to dock your iPhone to the beats system, 
			whereas other a Samsung S4 would just connect by pairing it wireless. 
			Being the first phone to use a 64 bit processor is more of a marketing tool than something that you'll truly 
			performance of the phone. The support for more RAM doesn't apply. 
			Is it really of that use given that the iOS 7 already support optimization for the new CPU.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			There's a big difference between new features and innovations. Just because add some “rainbow” colours 
			or add a new feature that no one else has or thought of does not make it a real innovation unless you are 
			talking in the most basic uninteresting form of innovation. Apple innovations should make people take notice, 
			the ones stated above are nothing to write home about and more of an evolution of the technology than a major 
			innovation.
